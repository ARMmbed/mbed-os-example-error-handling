## Requirements

This example program can be run on any Mbed-Enabled device. For demostration purposes, the below documentation uses K64F as the test device. 
One of the functionality with error handling feature is to save the error log in a file and that requires a storage support on the device. 
The example program does have sample code to invoke that functionality, but you will need to pass a special flag as part of your command if 
you want to test that functionality.

Note that the example application mostly uses MBED_WARNING macros to demostrate the usage. Usage of MBED_ERROR macros are identical but the behavior is 
different in that calling MBED_ERROR macros halt the application after the recording the error. So, in this test application MBED_ERROR() call 
is the last call we make.

## Setup

#### Clone the example

Setup your Mbed development environment as described in - [Get started with Mbed OS](https://os.mbed.com/docs/latest/tutorials/your-first-program.html).

From the command-line, clone the example:

```
git clone https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-example-error-handling
cd mbed-os-example-error-handling
mbed deploy
```

#### Compile the example

Compile the application as below using ARM compiler. If you want to use GCC or IAR toolchains, use GCC_ARM or IAR for -t option.

```
mbed compile -m K64F -t ARM
```
If you want to test the "saving error history to file" functionality you can build the program as below provided you have a SD card on the device.
```
mbed compile -t arm -m k64f -DMBED_TEST_SIM_BLOCKDEVICE=SDBlockDevice
```
You can also test this functionality using a simulated block device as 
```
mbed compile -t arm -m k64f -DMBED_TEST_SIM_BLOCKDEVICE=HeapBlockDevice
```

This may take few minutes and once its successfully completed it would generate the output as below.

```

#### Run the example

1. Connect a K64F device to your pc
1. Open a serial terminal connected to the device
1. Copy the binary file to the device.
1. Reset the device by pressing the reset button to start the program.

The output should look similar to below:
